T1	MajorClaim 200 349	I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:
T2	Claim 350 659	We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future.
T3	Premise 660 839	For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job.
T4	Claim 840 923	As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.
T5	Claim 924 1004	One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation.
T6	Premise 1005 1131	By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication.
T7	Premise 1132 1170	Commuincation can bring many benefits.
T8	Premise 1171 1350	For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal.
T9	Premise 1351 1536	Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers.
T10	Claim 1537 1598	So, relating well to people is also another important factor.
T11	Claim 1600 1846	In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.
