In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.
T6	Claim 1131 1451	Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, "Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“.

T7	Claim 1452 1763	However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people.
