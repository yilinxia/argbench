T1	MajorClaim 217 358	From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.
T2	Claim 359 494	It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation.
T3	Premise 495 694	As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation.
T4	Premise 695 892	In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them.
T5	Claim 893 963	Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.
T6	Claim 964 1054	Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions.
T7	Premise 1055 1328	If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles.
T8	Premise 1329 1558	For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.
T9	Claim 1559 1653	In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied.
T10	Claim 1654 1768	To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation.
T11	Premise 1769 1904	This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong.
T12	Premise 1905 2182	For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.
T13	Claim 2183 2328	Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication.
T14	Claim 2329 2439	On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.
