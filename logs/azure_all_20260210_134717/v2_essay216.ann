T1	MajorClaim 0 74	Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important
T2	Claim 229 360	From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.
T3	Premise 361 480	First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents.
T4	Premise 481 607	The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia.
T5	Premise 608 677	Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing.
T6	Premise 678 744	Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads.
T7	Premise 745 976	For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.
T8	Claim 977 1085	Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work.
T9	Premise 1086 1163	Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads.
T10	Premise 1164 1362	For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour.
T11	Premise 1363 1474	In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions.
T12	Claim 1476 1566	Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality.
T13	Premise 1567 1640	All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes.
T14	Premise 1641 1733	Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried.
T15	Premise 1734 1852	We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities.
T16	Premise 1853 1945	What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.
T17	Claim 1946 2064	In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable.
T18	Claim 2065 2204	I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.
