T1	MajorClaim 0 53	There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms
T2	Claim 171 295	I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Claim 296 371	There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers.
A2	Stance T3 Against
T4	Premise 372 421	Firstly, computers need to be operated by people.
T5	Premise 422 506	No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today.
T6	Premise 507 661	For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector.
T7	Premise 662 786	However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching.
T8	Claim 787 952	I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.
A3	Stance T8 Against
T9	Claim 953 996	Secondly, children need human interactions.
A4	Stance T9 Against
T10	Premise 997 1118	No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils.
T11	Premise 1119 1479	As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'.
T12	Premise 1480 1611	I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.
T13	Claim 1612 1668	In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher.
A5	Stance T13 Against
T14	Claim 1669 1791	I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place.
A6	Stance T14 Against
T15	Premise 1792 1863	Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.
