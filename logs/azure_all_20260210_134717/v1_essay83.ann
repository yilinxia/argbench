T1	MajorClaim 0 48	The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy
T2	Claim 349 418	I find myself aligned with opponenets of the usages of nuclear power.
A1	Stance T2	Against
T3	Claim 419 500	I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.
A2	Stance T3	Against
T4	Claim 501 615	First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons.
A3	Stance T4	Against
T5	Premise 616 671	Last centuary has witnesed the horrors of such weapons.
T6	Premise 672 779	If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for millitary usage.
T7	Claim 780 896	Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity.
A4	Stance T7	Against
T8	Premise 897 1066	For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area.
T9	Premise 1067 1166	This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are unevitable.
T10	Claim 1167 1319	Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power.
A5	Stance T10	Against
T11	Claim 1320 1426	Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanat solution of it.
A6	Stance T11	Against
T12	Premise 1427 1524	This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazordous material.
T13	Claim 1525 1703	To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may apear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the adavantages.
A7	Stance T13	Against
T14	Claim 1704 1796	Thus i suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.
