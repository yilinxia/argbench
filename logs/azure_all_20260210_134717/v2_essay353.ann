T1	MajorClaim 0 69	Children from poorer families are more successful in the future life.
T2	Claim 299 411	To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery.
T3	Claim 412 479	Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education.
T4	Premise 480 532	As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms.
T5	Premise 533 703	For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash.
T6	Premise 704 805	In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.
T7	Claim 806 946	Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life.
T8	Claim 947 1060	Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times.
