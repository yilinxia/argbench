T1	MajorClaim 200 407	After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.
T2	Claim 408 473	First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory.
T3	Premise 474 566	While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules.
T4	Premise 567 639	You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want.
T5	Premise 640 758	An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student.
T6	Premise 759 849	This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.
T7	Claim 850 945	Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive.
T8	Premise 946 974	This is only partially true,
T9	Premise 975 1071	you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper.
T10	Premise 1072 1163	Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday.
T11	Premise 1164 1246	You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car.
T12	Premise 1247 1331	The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.
T13	Claim 1332 1480	Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories.
T14	Premise 1481 1606	A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times.
T15	Premise 1607 1741	Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better.
T16	Premise 1742 1875	For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night.
T17	Premise 1876 1903	You set your own schedules.
T18	Claim 1904 2068	In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them.
T19	MajorClaim 2070 2223	To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.
