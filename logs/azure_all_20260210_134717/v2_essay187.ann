T1	MajorClaim 123 338	I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.
T2	Claim 339 454	Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method.
T3	Premise 455 514	In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country.
T4	Premise 515 600	Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language.
T5	Premise 601 752	Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.
T6	Claim 859 910	he has the opportunity to communicate with natives.
T7	Premise 911 1018	He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country.
T8	Premise 1019 1091	No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills.
T9	Premise 1092 1143	He also has access to the most up-to-date language.
T10	Premise 1144 1277	Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.
T11	Claim 1278 1413	On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice.
T12	Claim 1414 1522	There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language.
T13	Premise 1523 1739	When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.
T14	MajorClaim 1740 1967	In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.
