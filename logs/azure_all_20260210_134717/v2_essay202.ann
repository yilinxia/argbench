T1	MajorClaim 424 567	Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.
T2	Claim 568 622	The co-workers should be cooperative with one another.
T3	Premise 623 680	If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes.
T4	Premise 681 1082	I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor.
T5	Premise 1083 1209	When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse.
T6	Premise 1210 1378	From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility.
T7	Claim 1379 1499	Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.
T8	Claim 1500 1540	The co-workers need to trust each other.
T9	Claim 1541 1574	They should not act on suspicion.
T10	Premise 1575 1631	This is a very important aspect in the work environment.
T11	Premise 1632 2092	I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department.
T12	Claim 2094 2147	Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship.
T13	Premise 2148 2242	This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships.
T14	Premise 2243 2291	After all, you spend most of your day at office.
T15	Premise 2292 2357	If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.
