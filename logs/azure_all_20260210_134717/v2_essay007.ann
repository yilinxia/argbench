T1	MajorClaim 461 539	Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.
T2	Claim 540 651	First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers.
T3	Premise 652 889	Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime.
T4	Premise 890 1082	As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages.
T5	Claim 1083 1176	Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.
T6	Claim 1177 1325	Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one.
T7	Premise 1326 1440	It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries.
T8	Premise 1441 1623	The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet?
T9	Premise 1624 1688	The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so.
T10	Claim 1689 1839	For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.
T11	Claim 1840 1994	Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down.
T12	Premise 1995 2091	This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today.
T13	Claim 2092 2189	At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.
T14	Premise 2307 2452	However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.
