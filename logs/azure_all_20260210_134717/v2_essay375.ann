T1	MajorClaim 391 513	I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.
T2	Claim 514 604	There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money.
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Premise 605 829	Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them.
T4	Premise 830 1156	For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials.
T5	Premise 1157 1357	Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.
T6	Claim 1390 1477	i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages.

T7	Premise 1478 1566	This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication.
T8	Premise 1567 1685	In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved.
T9	Premise 1686 1804	Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world.
T10	Claim 1805 1952	Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.
A3	Stance T10 For
T11	Claim 1953 2170	In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.
