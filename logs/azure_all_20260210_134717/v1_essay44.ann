T1	MajorClaim 0 75	Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy
T2	Premise 77 174	The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past.
T3	Claim 175 295	It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly.
T4	Claim 674 822	If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity.
T5	Claim 823 936	Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.
T6	Premise 337 501	Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source.
T7	Premise 502 577	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short.
T8	Premise 937 1090	Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming.
T9	Premise 1091 1202	For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming.
T10	Premise 1203 1326	In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.
T11	MajorClaim 1327 1426	To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy.
T12	Premise 1427 1526	This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming.
T13	Claim 1527 1656	Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.
