T1	MajorClaim 141 276	To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control.
T2	Claim 278 416	First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime.
T3	Claim 417 461	However, this is not as simple as it sounds.
T4	Claim 463 599	In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally.
T5	Premise 600 762	People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control.
T6	Claim 869 942	As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself.
T7	Claim 943 1097	Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes.
T8	Claim 1099 1221	All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate.
T9	Claim 1222 1292	On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence.
T10	Claim 1293 1414	Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.
T11	Premise 764 868	Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens.
