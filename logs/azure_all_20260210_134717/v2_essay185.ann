T1	MajorClaim 132 245	as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.
T2	Claim 246 336	Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive.
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Premise 337 437	Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford.
T4	Premise 457 513	fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas.
T5	Premise 514 726	For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms.
T6	Claim 727 845	Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.
A2	Stance T6 Against
T7	Claim 846 1007	Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think.
A3	Stance T7 Against
T8	Premise 1008 1164	Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards.
T9	Premise 1165 1312	For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams.
T10	Premise 1313 1378	This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds.
T11	Premise 1379 1582	More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations.
T12	Claim 1583 1640	Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.
A4	Stance T12 Against
T13	Claim 1641 1876	Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions.
A5	Stance T13 Against
T14	Premise 1877 1983	For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain.
T15	Premise 1984 2084	These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy.
T16	Claim 2085 2141	With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.
A6	Stance T16 Against
T17	MajorClaim 2142 2282	In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.
