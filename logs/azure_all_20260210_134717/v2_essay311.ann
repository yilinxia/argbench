T1	MajorClaim 0 61	It is not necessary for university students to attend classes
T2	Claim 370 483	However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam.
T3	Premise 528 603	Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject.
T4	Premise 604 1026	For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again.
T5	Premise 1027 1181	Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics.
T6	Premise 1182 1242	And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.
T7	Claim 1243 1393	Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated.
T8	Premise 1394 1490	If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes.

T12	Premise 1641 1699	In the end, this student will become a loser in the world.
T13	Premise 1700 1781	And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class.
T14	Claim 1782 1861	This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.
T15	Claim 1862 2024	Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not.
T16	Claim 2025 2108	But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.
T17	Claim 2109 2360	All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.
