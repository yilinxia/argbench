T1	MajorClaim 284 387	From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.
T2	Claim 950 1037	In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.
T3	Premise 388 518	Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments.
T4	Premise 519 701	As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards.
T5	Premise 702 820	Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems.
T6	Premise 821 949	As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources.
T7	Claim 1038 1138	However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment.
T8	Premise 1139 1377	With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favourable impression on customers today, triggering sales.
T9	Premise 1378 1498	For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.
T10	Claim 1499 1589	Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies.
T11	Premise 1590 1755	If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity.
T12	Premise 1756 1804	Therefore, it may spur its economic development.
T13	Premise 1805 2031	On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic develpment.
T14	MajorClaim 2032 2150	Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously.
T15	Claim 2151 2386	On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.
