T1	MajorClaim 194 298	Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.
T2	Claim 299 391	First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk.
T3	Premise 392 479	Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way.
T4	Premise 480 535	If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment.
T5	Premise 536 659	Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal.
T6	Premise 660 751	In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck.
T7	Premise 752 818	And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.
T8	Claim 819 919	Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person.
T9	Premise 920 1034	In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination.
T10	Premise 1035 1170	They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal.
T11	Premise 1171 1245	If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading.
T12	Premise 1246 1487	For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery.
T13	Premise 1488 1577	However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened.
T14	Claim 1579 1701	Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target.
T15	Premise 1702 1830	For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion.
T16	Premise 1831 1939	He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors.
T17	Premise 1940 2066	Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply.
T18	Premise 2067 2262	At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity.
T19	Claim 2264 2342	Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good.
T20	Claim 2343 2444	Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.
