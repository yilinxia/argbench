T1	MajorClaim 0 79	Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else
T2	Claim 81 134	I completely agree that parents are the best teacher.
T3	Premise 135 268	Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.
T4	Claim 269 338	Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child.
T5	Premise 339 392	More power than any friend or other adult could have.
T6	Premise 393 617	For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.
T7	Claim 618 772	Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else.
T8	Premise 773 834	They have more contact and more intimacy with their children.
T9	Claim 836 896	Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents.
T10	Premise 897 1052	That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves.
T11	Premise 1053 1174	So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.
T12	Claim 1175 1374	All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.
