T2	Claim 51 130	I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life.
T3	Premise 131 351	It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.
T4	Claim 352 716	Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to.
T5	Premise 717 865	Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult.
T6	Claim 867 1003	Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day.

T12	Premise 1560 1697	In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.
T13	Claim 1698 1765	Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives.
T14	Premise 1766 1887	It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults.
T15	Premise 1888 2092	In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.
