T1	MajorClaim 0 75	Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy
T2	Claim 674 821	If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity
A1	Stance T2 For
T3	Premise 502 672	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India
T4	Claim 823 935	Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources

T6	Premise 1104 1201	the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming
T7	Premise 1203 1325	In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution
T8	MajorClaim 1340 1425	it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy
T9	Premise 1427 1525	This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming
T10	Claim 1527 1655	Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy
