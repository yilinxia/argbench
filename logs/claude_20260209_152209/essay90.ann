T1	MajorClaim 481 630	I suppose this suggestion is not advisable, for it cannot alter the situation essentially and instead it may give rise to new concerns in rural areas
T2	Claim 644 767	moving big companies, factories and their employees to the rural area can help ease traffic congestion and housing scarcity
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Premise 769 926	As people work in the countryside, they will not have to commute in cities at peak times such as eight o'clock in the morning or six o'clock in the afternoon
T4	Premise 928 1008	Consequently, urban traffic jam can be, to some extent, relieved in this respect
T5	Premise 1010 1186	On the other hand, the relocation of companies and factories in cities may leave more space to build new residential areas, thus alleviating the urban housing crisis at present
T6	Claim 1197 1282	the proposed measure is not fundamental to resolve urban traffic and housing problems
A2	Stance T6 For
T7	Premise 1284 1402	This is because some employees are reluctant to live in the rural areas only due to the relocation of their workplaces
T8	Premise 1404 1472	This can be best illustrated with the example of the married workers
T9	Premise 1474 1711	Taking into the growth of their children into consideration, the married workers may believe the educational resources in cities are far superior to ones in the countryside, and because of this, they probably opt for living in the cities
T10	Premise 1713 1852	Thus, these employers have to commute between the cities and the countryside, which is ineffective in tackling traffic and housing problems
T11	Premise 1854 1923	What is worse, the workers have to consume more time and traffic fees
T12	Claim 1931 2007	the suggested step can bring about environmental problems in the rural areas
A3	Stance T12 For
T13	Premise 2009 2141	As companies and factories move to the countryside, they may deplete the local natural resources as the raw materials for production
T14	Premise 2143 2238	Besides, the untreated pollutants the plants discharge can be damaging to the rural environment
T15	Premise 2240 2342	Therefore, moving companies, factories and employees to the rural areas can ruin the environment there
T16	MajorClaim 2375 2488	relocating big firms, factories and their employees is not sensible to address urban traffic and housing problems
