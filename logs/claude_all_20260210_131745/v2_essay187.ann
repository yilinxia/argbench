T1	MajorClaim 123 337	I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries
T2	Claim 339 453	Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Premise 471 513	he is not jumping into the foreign country
T4	Premise 515 599	Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language
T5	Premise 610 751	all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way
T6	Claim 772 909	when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives
A2	Stance T6 For
T7	Premise 911 1017	He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country
T8	Premise 1019 1090	No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills
T9	Premise 1092 1142	He also has access to the most up-to-date language
T10	Premise 1144 1276	Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to
T11	Claim 1292 1412	if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice
A3	Stance T11 For
T12	Premise 1414 1521	There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language
T13	Premise 1523 1738	When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible
T14	MajorClaim 1751 1966	although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language
