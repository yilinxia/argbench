T1	MajorClaim 157 244	these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal
T2	Claim 255 335	due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive
A1	Stance T2 For
T3	Premise 337 436	Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford
T4	Premise 457 512	fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas
T5	Premise 527 725	it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms
T6	Claim 732 844	the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming
A2	Stance T6 For
T7	Claim 939 1006	these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think
A3	Stance T7 For
T8	Premise 1008 1163	Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards
T9	Premise 1178 1311	the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams
T10	Premise 1313 1377	This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds
T11	Premise 1397 1581	the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations
T12	Claim 1588 1639	renewable resources are not as reliable as we think
A4	Stance T12 For
T13	Premise 1641 1781	Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming
T14	Claim 1783 1875	these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions
A5	Stance T14 For
T15	Premise 1889 1982	we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain
T16	Premise 1984 2083	These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy
T17	Claim 2085 2140	With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable
A6	Stance T17 For
T18	MajorClaim 2209 2281	there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon
