T1	MajorClaim 221 254	I tend to disagree with this view
T2	Claim 271 395	all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue
T3	Premise 454 611	a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment
T4	Premise 613 736	The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers
T5	Premise 738 848	Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society
T6	Claim 878 956	citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax
T7	Premise 970 1066	there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others
T8	Premise 1068 1199	It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough
T9	Premise 1201 1336	In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support
T10	Claim 1338 1448	Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force
T11	Premise 1450 1550	There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited

T13	MajorClaim 1843 1944	they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way
