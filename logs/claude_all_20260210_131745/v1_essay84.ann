T1	MajorClaim 374 515	I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money
T2	Claim 517 684	In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Premise 686 787	For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them
T4	Premise 789 947	With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job
T5	Premise 949 1069	Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with
T6	Premise 1071 1227	In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive
T7	Claim 1229 1350	Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money
A2	Stance T7 For
T8	Premise 1352 1485	This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country
T9	Premise 1487 1647	To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living
T10	Premise 1649 1753	To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed
T11	Claim 1755 1861	Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity
A3	Stance T11 For
T12	Premise 1863 1957	It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless
T13	Premise 1959 2070	Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones
T14	Premise 2072 2128	In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly
T15	Premise 2130 2262	On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment
T16	MajorClaim 2289 2460	the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment
T17	Claim 2462 2572	I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them
A4	Stance T17 For
T18	Premise 2574 2763	I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work
