T1	MajorClaim 0 75	Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy
T2	Premise 77 173	The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past
T3	Premise 175 294	It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly
T4	Premise 346 387	the major source of energy today is water
T5	Premise 389 500	Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source
T6	Premise 502 576	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short
T7	Premise 578 672	Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India
T8	Claim 674 821	If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity
T9	Claim 834 935	it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources
T10	Premise 947 1089	the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming
T11	Premise 1091 1201	For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming
T12	Claim 1203 1325	In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution
T13	MajorClaim 1340 1425	it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy
T14	Premise 1427 1525	This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming
T15	Claim 1527 1655	Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy
