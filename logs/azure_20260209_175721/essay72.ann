T4	Claim 765 865	Nevertheless, once they return to the society, they tend to relapse and get involved in drugs again.

T6	Claim 1030 1102	As such, all the efforts of putting them behind bars are simply in vain.
T7	Claim 1103 1201	Instead, if the addicts are sent to rehabilitation centres, they will treated for their addiction.
T8	Premise 1202 1307	On top of that, counselors can provide them with counseling and motivation to help them build a new life.
