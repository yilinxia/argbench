T1	MajorClaim 323 397	As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.
T2	Claim 398 544	Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums.
T3	Premise 566 746	an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games.
T4	Claim 758 847	providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.
T5	Claim 848 1194	Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government.
T6	Claim 1204 1394	the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.
T7	Claim 1408 1512	putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them.
T8	Premise 1526 1581	not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot.
T9	Claim 1593 1699	it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs.
T10	Premise 1700 1879	That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.
T11	MajorClaim 1880 2148	To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.
