T1	MajorClaim 471 639	Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.
T2	Claim 640 729	Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down.
T3	Premise 730 878	This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced.
T4	Premise 879 1081	To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight.
T5	Premise 1082 1205	Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops.
T6	Claim 1206 1301	Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.
T7	Claim 1302 1664	Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded.
T8	Premise 1665 1794	In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken.
T9	Claim 1795 1900	In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.
T10	Claim 1983 2097	Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras.
T11	Claim 2098 2252	However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences.
T12	Claim 2253 2390	Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.
T13	MajorClaim 2391 2480	To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise.
T14	Premise 2481 2561	This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers.
T15	Claim 2562 2623	Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras.
T16	Claim 2624 2684	Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.
