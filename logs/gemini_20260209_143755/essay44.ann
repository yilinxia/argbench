T1	MajorClaim 1327 1426	To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy.
T2	Premise 77 174	The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past.
T3	Premise 175 295	It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly.
T4	Premise 337 388	Firstly, the major source of energy today is water.
T5	Premise 389 501	Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source.
T6	Premise 502 577	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short.
T7	Premise 578 673	Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India.
T8	Claim 674 822	If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity.
