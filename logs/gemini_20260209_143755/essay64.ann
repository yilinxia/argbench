T1	MajorClaim 396 487	For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.

T3	Premise 662 861	This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future.
T4	Premise 862 1020	At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.
