============================================================
PROMPT USED
============================================================

You are an expert in argument mining and discourse analysis. Your task is to annotate argumentative essays by identifying argument components and their relationships.

## Annotation Schema

### Entity Types:
1. **MajorClaim**: The main thesis or central claim of the essay. Usually appears in the introduction or conclusion.
2. **Claim**: A statement that supports or attacks the MajorClaim. Claims express the author's stance on sub-topics.
3. **Premise**: Evidence, reasoning, or examples that support or attack a Claim.

### Attributes:
- **Stance**: For Claims only. Indicates whether the Claim supports (For) or opposes (Against) the MajorClaim.

### Relations:
- **supports**: The source argument component provides support for the target.
- **attacks**: The source argument component opposes or contradicts the target.

## Output Format (BRAT Standoff Format)

Generate annotations in this exact format:

1. **Entity annotations** (T lines):
   `T<id>	<Type> <start_offset> <end_offset>	<text>`
   - id: Sequential number starting from 1
   - Type: MajorClaim, Claim, or Premise
   - start_offset: Character position where the span starts (0-indexed)
   - end_offset: Character position where the span ends
   - text: The exact text span from the essay

2. **Attribute annotations** (A lines):
   `A<id>	Stance T<entity_id> <For|Against>`
   - Only for Claim entities
   - For: The claim supports the MajorClaim
   - Against: The claim opposes the MajorClaim

3. **Relation annotations** (R lines):
   `R<id>	<supports|attacks> Arg1:T<source_id> Arg2:T<target_id>`
   - source_id: The entity providing support/attack
   - target_id: The entity being supported/attacked

## Important Rules:
1. Character offsets must be EXACT - count characters precisely from the start of the text (0-indexed).
2. The text span must match EXACTLY what appears at those offsets.
3. Every Claim must have a Stance attribute.
4. Relations typically flow: Premise -> Claim -> MajorClaim
5. Claims can also support/attack other Claims.
6. Premises can support/attack Claims or other Premises.
7. Do NOT include any explanation or commentary - output ONLY the annotation lines.
