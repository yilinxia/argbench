T1	MajorClaim 235 407	It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.
T2	Claim 557 669	I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work.
T3	Premise 670 918	It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning.
T4	Premise 919 1274	If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth?

T8	Premise 1844 1935	it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.
T9	Claim 1958 2032	I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work
T10	Premise 2034 2160	on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.
