T2	Claim 255 336	due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive.
A1	Stance T2 For
T3	Premise 337 437	Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford.
T4	Premise 457 513	fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas.
T5	Premise 527 726	it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms.
T6	Premise 732 845	the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.
T7	Claim 939 1007	these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think.
A2	Stance T7 For
T8	Premise 1008 1164	Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards.
T9	Premise 1178 1312	the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams.
