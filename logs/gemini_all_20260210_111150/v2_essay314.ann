T1	MajorClaim 2319 2507	To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.
T2	Claim 499 569	even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy.
T3	Claim 1237 1345	the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality.
T4	Claim 1867 2012	Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic.
T5	Premise 570 638	Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy.
T6	Premise 639 821	If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline.
T7	Premise 822 891	In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless.

T13	Premise 2013 2145	A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars.
T14	Premise 2146 2318	In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.
