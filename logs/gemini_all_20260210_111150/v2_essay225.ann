T1	MajorClaim 51 130	I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life.
T2	Claim 611 716	But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to.
T3	Premise 352 610	Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community.
T4	Premise 717 865	Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult.
T5	Claim 867 1003	Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day.
T6	Premise 1004 1295	Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.
T7	Claim 1296 1395	Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child.
T8	Premise 1396 1697	Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.
T9	Premise 1766 1887	It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults.
T10	Premise 1888 2092	In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.
