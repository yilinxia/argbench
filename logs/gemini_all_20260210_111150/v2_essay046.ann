T1	MajorClaim 640 705	I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.
T2	Claim 706 796	A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge.
T3	Premise 797 954	What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge.
T4	Premise 955 1208	High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.
T5	Claim 885 1045	it is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed.
T6	Claim 1490 1667	So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.
T7	Claim 1683 1779	the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources.
