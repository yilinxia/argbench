T1	MajorClaim 397 470	I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition.
T2	Claim 472 594	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks
T3	Premise 674 899	I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test.
T4	Claim 900 971	Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives.
