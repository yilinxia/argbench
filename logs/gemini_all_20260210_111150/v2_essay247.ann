T1	MajorClaim 256 371	Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.
T2	Claim 381 490	people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages.
T3	Premise 521 660	Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle.
T4	Premise 661 811	From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city.
T5	Premise 812 893	I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away.
T6	Premise 894 1072	Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.
T7	Claim 1086 1202	cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home.
T8	Claim 1203 1239	Furthermore, they are more flexible.
T9	Premise 1240 1343	My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money.
T10	Premise 1344 1461	He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend.
T11	Premise 1462 1628	If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.
T12	Claim 1638 1719	the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world.
T13	Premise 1720 1818	If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life.
T14	Premise 1819 1906	They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas.
T15	Premise 1907 2046	There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car.
T16	Premise 2047 2151	As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.
T17	Premise 2152 2501	In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.
